# Continous Integration

The framework has been successfully tested using `PHP 7.1`, `PHP 7.2` and `nightly` with all algorithms.

Tests vectors from the [RFC 7520](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7520) are fully implemented and all tests pass. Other test vector sources may be used \(e.g. new algorithm specifications\).

We also track bugs and code quality using [Scrutinizer-CI](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/web-token/jwt-framework) and [Sensio Insight](https://insight.sensiolabs.com/projects/b7efa68f-8962-41cf-a2e3-4444426bc95a).

Coding Standards are verified by [StyleCI](https://styleci.io/repos/105997386).

Code coverage is analyzed by [Coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/github/web-token/jwt-framework).
